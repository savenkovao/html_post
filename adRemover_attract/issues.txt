HI Ivan... We have a few things that are not working.

1. Can you please look at this in outlook. It's really bad when viewed in that. We will need to fix that. 
2. Also in Gmail, the example-img does not show for some reason.
3. Can we make that example image smaller? It's really big. I had to make it smaller so blue Hornet would except it. That is whom we use for sending out emails.
4. Also, the logo looks really blurry. Can we please look at that. This is for both email cuts.
